## Summary  

Bitcoin introduces asymmetric risk-reward profiles to corporate treasury strategy through synthetic convexity—especially powerful when layered with traditional corporate finance tools like leverage and long-duration debt.

## Section Highlights  

### 00:12 - Convexity Thesis  

- ✍️ Bitcoin as “long volatility, long duration” asset  
- 📌 **Pillar - Treasury Allocation**: Offers new perspective on corporate reserve asset selection  
- 🗒 **Post Idea**: Bitcoin as Corporate Convexity: A New Treasury Playbook  
- 🔗 **Pillars**: Treasury Allocation, Capital Structure

### 00:34 - Balance Sheet Strategy  

- ✍️ Using debt to hold BTC amplifies upside  
- 📌 **Pillar - Capital Structure**: Demonstrates “synthetic duration arbitrage” potential

## Personal Reflections  

Changed how I view treasury not as a passive reserve but as a risk-shaping tool. Convexity language may be useful to explain this to board-level audiences.

## Framework Impact  

Add note under Treasury Allocation: convexity = asymmetric upside  
Add note under Capital Structure: BTC-backed balance sheet strategy
