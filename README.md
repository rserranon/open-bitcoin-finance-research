# 🧠 Bitcoin Knowledge Vault

This is a personal knowledge repository to support the development and refinement of the **Strategic Bitcoin Finance framework**. It helps me log, organize, and synthesize key ideas from books, articles, podcasts, and other sources related to Bitcoin, macroeconomics, corporate finance, and valuation.

## 📚 Purpose

- Capture structured notes and insights from everything I read or listen to
- Tag observations and concepts that relate to the strategic framework
- Generate a Hugo-compatible `strategic-pillars.md` file
- Maintain a knowledge base under version control (GitHub)
